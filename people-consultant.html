                    Mr. Lim Ewe Guan is a distinguished educator known for his instrumental role at SMK Seri Kembangan
                    as a Consultant Teacher for the 24 Season Drum. With a wealth of experience, he also served as the
                    Head of the English Department, contributing significantly to the school's academic excellence and
                    cultural enrichment.
                    <br><br>
                    Under his guidance, the 24 Season Drum team flourished, attaining remarkable achievements and
                    recognition both within and beyond the school's walls. Mr. Lim's visionary leadership extended
                    beyond the classroom, as he actively led the team to mesmerizing performances at various external
                    venues, fostering a wider appreciation for the art of drumming.

                    himself to nurturing both students' academic pursuits and their artistic talents. His tenure

                    unwavering dedication, innovative approach, and profound impact on the school community.
